# SKILLS.md — Snow-Flow Skill Index

This file lists every skill bundled with Snow-Flow. Skills are **specialized knowledge packages** loaded on demand. To use a skill, call:

```javascript
Skill({ skill: "skill-name" })
```

Only load a skill when the current task touches its domain. Skills are lazy-loaded for the same reason MCP tools are: keeping unused content out of the context window.

The authoritative description for each skill lives in its own `SKILL.md` frontmatter — this index is just a map.

## How to use

Skills complement the rules in `AGENTS.md`. Always follow the hard rules from `AGENTS.md` (Update Set first, ES5 only, silent tool discovery) — skills add domain-specific patterns on top.

```javascript
Skill({ skill: "flow-designer" })       // before creating a flow
Skill({ skill: "widget-coherence" })    // before building a Service Portal widget
Skill({ skill: "es5-compliance" })      // when writing or reviewing server-side JS
Skill({ skill: "update-set-workflow" }) // when the Update Set behavior is unclear
Skill({ skill: "debugging-mutations" }) // when verifying what a tool actually changed
```

Don't load every skill upfront. Load the one(s) the current task actually needs.
